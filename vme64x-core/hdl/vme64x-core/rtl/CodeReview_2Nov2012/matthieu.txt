General comments:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Add a reset output port on core's top level.
  This reset should come from the software reset bit in CSR.

* Update the Manifest file.
  -> Remove VME_DpBlockRam.vhd
  -> Add VME_CRAM.vhd

* Change MBLT endian register name to SWAP configuration register (or something similar).

* Move to a git repository.
